Recent work suggests that some auto-encoder variants do a good job of capturing the local manifold structure of data. This paper clarifies some of these previous intuitive observations by showing that minimizing a particular form of regularized reconstruction error yields a reconstruction function that locally characterizes the shape of the data generating density. We show that the auto-encoder captures the score (derivative of the log-density with respect to the input), along with the second derivative of the density and the local mean associated with the unknown data-generating density. This is the second result linking denoising auto-encoders and score matching, but in way that is different from previous work, and can be applied to the case when the auto-encoder reconstruction function does not necessarily correspond to the derivative of an energy function. The theorems provided here are completely generic and do not depend on the parametrization of the auto-encoder: they show what the auto-encoder would tend to if given enough capacity and examples. These results are for a contractive training criterion we show to be similar to the denoising auto-encoder training criterion with small corruption noise, but with contraction applied on the whole reconstruction function rather than just encoder. Similarly to score matching, one can consider the proposed training criterion as a convenient alternative to maximum likelihood, i.e., one not involving a partition function.}

     abstract = {We introduce a novel training principle for probabilistic models that is an alternative to maximum likelihood. The proposed Generative Stochastic Networks (GSN) framework is based on learning the transition operator of a {Markov} chain whose stationary distribution estimates the data distribution. Because the transition distribution is a conditional distribution generally involving a small move, it has fewer dominant modes, being unimodal in the limit of small moves. Thus, it is easier to learn, more like learning to perform supervised function approximation, with gradients that can be obtained by back-propagation. The theorems provided here generalize recent work on the probabilistic interpretation of denoising auto-encoders and provide an interesting justification for dependency networks and generalized pseudolikelihood (along with defining an appropriate joint distribution and sampling mechanism, even when the conditionals are not consistent). We study how GSNs can be used with missing inputs and can be used to sample subsets of variables given the rest. Successful experiments are conducted, validating these theoretical results, on two image datasets and with a particular architecture that mimics the Deep {Boltzmann} Machine Gibbs sampler but allows training to proceed with backprop, without the need for layerwise pretraining.}

Self-taught learning (exploiting unlabeled examples or examples from other distributions) has already been applied to deep learners, but mostly to show the advantage of unlabeled examples. Here we explore the advantage brought by {\em out-of-distribution examples}. For this purpose we developed a powerful generator of stochastic variations and noise processes for character images, including not only affine transformations but also slant, local elastic deformations, changes in thickness, background images, grey level changes, contrast, occlusion, and various types of noise. The out-of-distribution examples are obtained from these highly distorted images or by including examples of object classes different from those in the target test set. We show that {\em deep learners benefit more from out-of-distribution examples than a corresponding shallow learner}, at least in the area of handwritten character recognition. In fact, we show that they beat previously published results and reach human-level performance on both handwritten digit classification and 62-class handwritten character recognition.}

     abstract = {Open-text (or open-domain) semantic parsers are designed to interpret any statement in natural language by inferring a corresponding meaning representation (MR). Unfortunately, large scale systems cannot be easily machine-learned due to lack of directly supervised data. We propose here a method that learns to assign MRs to a wide range of text (using a dictionary of more than 70,000 words, which are mapped to more than 40,000 entities) thanks to a training scheme that combines learning from WordNet and ConceptNet with learning from raw text. The model learns structured embeddings of words, entities and MRs via a multi-task training process operating on these diverse sources of data that integrates all the learnt knowledge into a single system. This work ends up combining methods for knowledge acquisition, semantic parsing, and word-sense disambiguation. Experiments on various tasks indicate that our approach is indeed successful and can form a basis for future more sophisticated systems.}

estimates the principal eigenfunctions of an operator that depends on
the unknown data density and on a kernel that is not necessarily positive
semi-definite. This helps to generalize some of these algorithms so as to predict
an embedding for out-of-sample examples without having to retrain the

Known labels are used to propagate information through the graph in order to label
all nodes. In this chapter, we show how these different algorithms can be cast into
a common framework where one minimizes a quadratic cost criterion whose closed-form solution is found by solving a linear system of size n (total number of data
points). The cost criterion naturally leads to an extension of such algorithms to
the inductive setting, where one obtains test samples one at a time: the derived
induction formula can be evaluated in O(n) time, which is much more efficient
than solving again exactly the linear system (which in general costs O(kn2) time
for a sparse graph where each data point has k neighbors). We also use this inductive
formula to show that when the similarity between points satisfies a locality property,
then the algorithms are plagued by the curse of dimensionality, with respect to the
dimensionality of an underlying manifold.},

endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal
need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present
mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches
to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited
in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis
focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in
which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer
of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient
in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second,
we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the
curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning)
and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant
image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in
which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract
and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the
potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and
that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required

We are particularly interested in estimators of the gradient of the log-likelihood obtained through this expansion. We show that its residual term converges to zero, justifying the use of a truncation, i.e. running only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the Contrastive Divergence (CD) estimator of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked auto-associators.  The derivation is not specific to the particular parametric forms used in RBMs, and only requires convergence of the Gibbs chain. We present theoretical and empirical evidence linking the number of Gibbs steps $k$ and the magnitude of the RBM parameters to the bias in the CD estimator. These experiments also suggest that the sign of the CD estimator is correct most of the time, even when the bias is large, so that CD-$k$ is a good descent direction even for small $k$.}

We are particularly interested in estimators of the gradient of the log-likelihood obtained through this expansion. We show that its terms converge to zero, justifying the use of a truncation, i.e. running only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the Contrastive Divergence approximation of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked auto-associators. The derivation is not specific to the particular parametric forms used in RBMs, and only requires convergence of the Gibbs chain.}

chapter focuses on what is required for the learning of complex behaviors. We
believe it involves the learning of highly varying functions, in a
mathematical sense. We bring forward two types of arguments which convey
the message that many currently popular machine learning approaches to
learning flexible functions have fundamental limitations that render them 
inappropriate for learning highly varying functions. The first issue
concerns the representation of such functions with what we call shallow model
architectures.  We discuss limitations of shallow architectures, such as
so-called kernel machines, boosting algorithms, and one-hidden-layer artificial neural
networks.  The second issue is more focused and concerns kernel machines
with a local kernel (the type used most often in practice),
that act like a collection of template matching units. We present
mathematical results on such computational architectures showing that they
have a limitation similar to those already proved for older non-parametric
methods, and connected to the so-called curse of dimensionality. Though it has long
been believed that efficient learning in deep architectures is difficult,
recently proposed computational principles for learning in deep architectures
may offer a breakthrough.}

It is articulated around the following hypotheses: (1) learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effective local minima; (2) this optimization difficulty is particularly important when it comes to learning higher-level abstractions, i.e., concepts that cover a vast and highly-nonlinear span of sensory configurations; (3) such high-level abstractions are best represented in brains by the composition of many levels of representation, i.e., by deep architectures; (4) a human brain can learn such high-level abstractions if guided by the signals produced by other humans, which act as hints or indirect supervision for these high-level abstractions; and (5), language and the recombination and optimization of mental concepts provide an efficient evolutionary recombination operator, and this gives rise to rapid search in the space of communicable ideas that help humans build up better high-level internal representations of their world. These hypotheses put together imply that human culture and the evolution of ideas have been crucial to counter an optimization difficulty: this optimization difficulty would otherwise make it very difficult for human brains to capture high-level knowledge of the world. The theory is grounded in experimental observations of the difficulties of training deep artificial neural networks. Plausible consequences of this theory for the efficiency of cultural evolutions are sketched.}

The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with {LLE}, {Isomap}, spectral clustering and {MDS} show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding.},

A previously proposed method is based on constructing a non-parametric density estimator of the model's probability function from samples generated by the model. We revisit this idea, propose a more efficient estimator, and prove that it provides a lower bound on the true test log-likelihood, and an unbiased estimator as the number of generated samples goes to infinity, although one that incorporates the effect of poor mixing (making the estimated likelihood worse, i.e., more conservative).}

the {Markov} chain is conditional on the previous
state, generally involving a small move, so this
conditional distribution has fewer dominant

moves. Thus, it is easier to learn because it
is easier to approximate its partition function,
more like learning to perform supervised func-

obtained by backprop. We provide theorems
that generalize recent work on the probabilistic
interpretation of denoising autoencoders and
obtain along the way an interesting justiﬁca-

pseudolikelihood, along with a deﬁnition of
an appropriate joint distribution and sampling
mechanism even when the conditionals are not

The main theorem shows that there exists no universal (valid under all distributions) unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. The analysis that accompanies this result is based on the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of errors, which has only three different eigenvalues corresponding to three degrees of freedom of the matrix and three components of the total variance. This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make naive estimators (that dont take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance.

     abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms can be formulated as the minimization of a training criterion which involves (1) training errors on each training example and (2) some hyper-parameters, which are kept fixed during this minimization.	 When there is only a single hyper-parameter one can easily explore how its value aects a model selection criterion (that is not the same as the training criterion, and is used to select hyper-parameters).	In this paper we present a methodology to select many hyper-parameters that is based on the computation of the gradient of a model selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters. We first consider the case of a training criterion that is quadratic in the parameters. In that case, the gradient of the selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters is efficiently computed by back-propagating through a Cholesky decomposition. In the more general case, we show that the implicit function theorem can be used to derive a formula for the hyper-parameter gradient, but this formula requires the computation of second derivatives of the training criterion},

Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities

highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how
to train such deep networks, since gradient-based
optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck
in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced
a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief
Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal
variables. In the context of the above optimization problem,
we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to
better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are
continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not
revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task.
Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy
layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the
optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a
good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations
that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.}

  abstract = {A language model is a function, or an algorithm for learning such a function, that captures the salient statistical characteristics of the distribution of sequences of words in a natural language, typically allowing one to make probabilistic predictions of the next word given preceding ones.

A neural network language model is a language model based on Neural Networks , exploiting their ability to learn distributed representations to reduce the impact of the curse of dimensionality.

In the context of learning algorithms, the curse of dimensionality refers to the need for huge numbers of training examples when learning highly complex functions. When the number of input variables increases, the number of required examples can grow exponentially. The curse of dimensionality arises when a huge number of different combinations of values of the input variables must be discriminated from each other, and the learning algorithm needs at least one example per relevant combination of values. In the context of language models, the problem comes from the huge number of possible sequences of words, e.g., with a sequence of 10 words taken from a vocabulary of 100,000 there are 10^{50} possible sequences...

A distributed representation of a symbol is a tuple (or vector) of features which characterize the meaning of the symbol, and are not mutually exclusive. If a human were to choose the features of a word, he might pick grammatical features like gender or plurality, as well as semantic features like animate" or invisible. With a neural network language model, one relies on the learning algorithm to discover these features, and the features are continuous-valued (making the optimization problem involved in learning much simpler).

The basic idea is to learn to associate each word in the dictionary with a continuous-valued vector representation. Each word corresponds to a point in a feature space. One can imagine that each dimension of that space corresponds to a semantic or grammatical characteristic of words. The hope is that functionally similar words get to be closer to each other in that space, at least along some directions. A sequence of words can thus be transformed into a sequence of these learned feature vectors. The neural network learns to map that sequence of feature vectors to a prediction of interest, such as the probability distribution over the next word in the sequence. What pushes the learned word features to correspond to a form of semantic and grammatical similarity is that when two words are functionally similar, they can be replaced by one another in the same context, helping the neural network to compactly represent a function that makes good predictions on the training set, the set of word sequences used to train the model.

The advantage of this distributed representation approach is that it allows the model to generalize well to sequences that are not in the set of training word sequences, but that are similar in terms of their features, i.e., their distributed representation. Because neural networks tend to map nearby inputs to nearby outputs, the predictions corresponding to word sequences with similar features are mapped to similar predictions. Because many different combinations of feature values are possible, a very large set of possible meanings can be represented compactly, allowing a model with a comparatively small number of parameters to fit a large training set.}

  abstract = {We consider problems of sequence processing and propose a solution based on a discrete state model in order to represent past context. We introduce a recurrent connectionist architecture having a modular structure that associates a subnetwork to each state. The model has a statistical interpretation we call Input/Output Hidden {Markov} Model ({IOHMM}). It can be trained by the {EM} or {GEM} algorithms, considering state trajectories as missing data, which decouples temporal credit assignment and actual parameter estimation.
The model presents similarities to hidden {Markov} models ({HMM}s), but allows us to map input sequences to output sequences, using the same processing style as recurrent neural networks. {IOHMM}s are trained using a more discriminant learning paradigm than {HMM}s, while potentially taking advantage of the {EM} algorithm.
We demonstrate that {IOHMM}s are well suited for solving grammatical inference problems on a benchmark problem. Experimental results are presented for the seven Tomita grammars, showing that these adaptive models can attain excellent generalization.},

We find here with noisy time-series that better results can be obtained when the model is directly trained in order to maximize the financial criterion of interest, here gains and losses (including those due to transactions) incurred during trading.

The proposed method of automatically finding the learning rule relies on the idea of considering the synaptic modification rule as a parametric function. This function has local inputs and is the same in many neurons. The parameters that define this function can be estimated with known learning methods. For this optimization, we give particular attention to gradient descent and genetic algorithms. In both cases, estimation of this function consists of a joint global optimization of (a) the synaptic modification function, and (b) the networks that are learning to perform some tasks. The proposed methodology can be used as a tool to explore the missing pieces of the puzzle of neural networks learning. Both network architecture, and the learning function can be designed within constraints derived from biological knowledge.},

  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

Two aspects must be considered, (1) some types of events (e.g., abnormal or rare) will not appear in the data set, but the system should be able to detect them, (2) not only classification of signals but also their interpretation are important for nuclear plant monitoring. We address both issues with a mixture of mixtures of Gaussians in which some parameters are shared to reflect the similar signals observed in different states of the reactor. An {EM} algorithm for these shared Gaussian mixtures is presented. Experimental results on nuclear plant data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach with respect to the above two points.},

To address this issue we propose to use recurrent networks with feedback into the input units, based on two fundamental ideas. The first motivation is that the filled-in value of the missing variable may not only depend in complicated ways on the value of this variable in the past of the sequence but also on the current and past values of other variables. The second motivation is that, for the purpose of making predictions or taking decisions, it is not always necessary to fill in the best possible value of the missing variables. In fact, it is sufficient to fill in a value which helps the system make better predictions or decisions. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated through experiments on several tasks.},

    is a crude predictor of neuron response in visual area V1.
    More descriptive models of V1 have been advanced that are no more computationally expensive,
    yet artificial neural network research continues to focus on networks of affine-sigmoidal models.
    This paper identifies two qualitative differences between the affine-sigmoidal hidden unit
    and a particular recent model of V1 response:
    a) the presence of a low-rank quadratic term in the argument to $\sigma$, 
    and b) the use of a gentler non-linearity than the $\tanh$ or logistic sigmoid.
    We evaluate these model ingredients by training single-layer 
    neural networks to solve three image classification tasks.
    We experimented with fully-connected hidden units,
    as well as locally-connected units and convolutional units
    that more closely mimic the function and connectivity of the visual system.
    On all three tasks, both the quadratic interactions and the gentler non-linearity
    lead to significantly better generalization.
    The advantage of quadratic units was strongest in conjunction with sparse and convolutional hidden units.}

them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}

  abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for
hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and
theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for
hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence
comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid
search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief
networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid
search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to
find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the
computation time. Granting random search the same computational
budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a
larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief
networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and
grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional
configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of
seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian
process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation
set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the
hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters
are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid
search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our
analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods
achieve surprising success-they appear to search through a large
number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter
much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models
will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter
optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline
against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive
(sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.}

  different rigorous symbolic framework which makes it hard to use

  These learnt embeddings would allow data from any KB to be easily
  used in recent machine learning methods for prediction and information

These classiﬁers combine the responses of the voxels to detect and categorize diﬀerent brain states. They allow a more agnostic analysis than conventional fMRI analysis that systematically treats weak and distributed patterns as unwanted noise. In this project, we use such classiﬁers to validate an hypothesis concerning the encoding of sounds in the human brain. More precisely, we attempt to locate neurons tuned to spectral and temporal modulations in sound. We use fMRI recordings of brain responses of subjects listening to 49 diﬀerent spectro-temporal modulations. The analysis of fMRI data through linear classiﬁers is not yet a standard procedure in this ﬁeld. Thus, an important objective of this project, in the long term, is the development of new machine learning algorithms specialized for neuroimaging data. For these reasons, an important part of the experiments is dedicated to studying the behaviour of the classiﬁers. We are mainly interested in 3 standard linear classiﬁers, namely the support vectors machine algorithm (linear), the logistic regression algorithm (regularized) and the na{\"{\i}}ve bayesian gaussian model (shared variances).}

  abstract = {This thesis studies models of high-dimensional sequences based on recurrent neural networks ({RNN}s) and their application to music and speech. While in principle {RNN}s can represent the long-term dependencies and complex temporal dynamics present in real-world sequences such as video, audio and natural language, they have not been used to their full potential since their introduction by Rumelhart et al. (1986a) due to the difficulty to train them efficiently by gradient-based optimization. In recent years, the successful application of Hessian-free optimization and other advanced training techniques motivated an increase of their use in many state-of-the-art systems. The work of this thesis is part of this development. The main idea is to exploit the power of {RNN}s to learn a probabilistic description of sequences of symbols, i.e. high-level information associated with observed signals, that in turn can be used as a prior to improve the accuracy of information retrieval. For example, by modeling the evolution of note patterns in polyphonic music, chords in a harmonic progression, phones in a spoken utterance, or individual sources in an audio mixture, we can improve significantly the accuracy of polyphonic transcription, chord recognition, speech recognition and audio source separation respectively. The practical application of our models to these tasks is detailed in the last four articles presented in this thesis. In the first article, we replace the output layer of an {RNN} with conditional restricted {Boltzmann} machines to describe much richer multimodal output distributions. In the second article, we review and develop advanced techniques to train {RNN}s. In the last four articles, we explore various ways to combine our symbolic models with deep networks and non-negative matrix factorization algorithms, namely using products of experts, input/output architectures, and generative frameworks that generalize hidden {Markov} models. We also propose and analyze efficient inference procedures for those models, such as greedy chronological search, high-dimensional beam search, dynamic programming-like pruned beam search and gradient descent. Finally, we explore issues such as label bias, teacher forcing, temporal smoothing, regularization and pre-training.}

We first justify such approaches as ways to escape modes while approximately keeping the same asymptotic distribution of the {Markov} chain. We then extend FPCD using an idea borrowed from Herding in order to obtain a pure sampling algorithm and show empirically that this FPCD-sampler yields substantially better samples than Gibbs sampling. Because these algorithms entangle the model and the sampling algorithm and we want to evaluate both (but particularly how well the sampling schemes mix), it is not always easy to evaluate them, so we propose a “black-box” approach based on how well and how quickly the samples generated by a model “cover” the test set examples. We empirically study these algorithms and variations with this perspective and these new evaluation tools in order to better understand their strengths and limitations.}

Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has developped principled methods based on asymptotic results to estimate the tails of most distributions. However, the finite sample approximation might introduce a severe bias in many cases. Moreover, the full range of the distribution is often needed, not only the tail area. On the other hand, non-parametric methods, while being powerful where data are abundant, fail to extrapolate properly in the tail area. We put forward a non-parametric density estimator that brings together the strengths of non-parametric density estimation and of EVT.  A hybrid {Pareto} distribution that can be used in a mixture model is proposed to extend the generalized {Pareto} (GP) to the whole real axis. Experiments on simulated data show the following. On one hand, the mixture of hybrid {Pareto}s converges faster in terms of log-likelihood and provides good estimates of the tail of the distributions when compared with other density estimators including the GP distribution. On the other hand, the mixture of hybrid {Pareto}s offers an alternate way to estimate the tail index which is comparable to the one estimated with the standard GP methodology. The mixture of hybrids is also evaluated on the Danish fire insurance data set.}

  abstract = {We put forward a class of density estimators that can adapt to asymmetric, multi-modal and heavy-tailed distributions. Such distributions occur in many application domains such as finance and insurance. Mixture of gaussians are flexible non-parametric density estimators that have good approximation properties when the number of components is well chosen with respect to the training set size. However, those models are performing poorly on heavy-tailed data because few observations occur in the tail area. To solve this problem, we resort to extreme value theory where methods based on sound parametric assumptions have been developped to enable extrapolation beyond the range of the observations. More precisely, we build on the PoT method that was developped in hydrology where PoT stands for  "Peaks-over-Threshold". The observations exceeding a given threshold are modeled by the generalized {Pareto} distribution. This distribution can approximate arbitrarily well the tail of most distributions. We build a new distribution, the hybrid {Pareto}, by stitching together a truncated Normal and a generalized {Pareto} distribution. We impose continuity constraints at the junction point. The hybrid {Pareto} is thus a smooth distribution that can be used in a mixture model.  The behavior of the upper tail of the hybrid is similar to the behavior of the generalized {Pareto} tail. Moreover, the threshold inherent in the the PoT methodology can now be defined implicitly as the junction point of the component with the heaviest tail. This component also determines the tail index of the mixture. Hence, the hybrid {Pareto} mixture offers an alternate way to estimate the tail index associated with heavy-tailed data. In several applications, information that has predictive power on the variable of interest is available. In that case, we want to model the conditional density of Y given X, the vector containing predictive information. When the distribution of Y given X is asymmetric, multi-modal and heavy-tailed, we propose to use a mixure of hybrid {Pareto}s whose parameters are functions of X. Those functions are implemented by means of a neural network with one hidden layer. Neural neworks are non-parametric models that can, in principle, approximate any continuous function.  Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that the hybrid {Pareto} mixture, unconditional and conditional, outperforms other density estimators in terms of log-likelihood.}

compare two paradigms for making the allocation using neural networks. The first one uses the network to make a forecast of asset behavior, in conjunction with a traditional mean-variance allocator for constructing the portfolio. The second paradigm uses the network to directly make the portfolio allocation decisions. We consider a method for performing soft input variable selection, and show its considerable utility. We use model combination (committee) methods to systematize the choice of hyperparemeters during training. We show that committees
using both paradigms are significantly outperforming the benchmark market performance.},

     title = {Extensions to Metric-Based Model Selection},
      year = {2003},
  crossref = {JMLR},
  abstract = {Metric-based methods have recently been introduced for model selection and regularization, often yielding very significant improvements over the alternatives tried (including cross-validation). All these methods require unlabeled data over which to compare functions and detect gross differences in behavior away from the training points. We introduce three new extensions of the metric model selection methods and apply them to feature selection. The first extension takes advantage of the particular case of time-series data in which the task involves prediction with a horizon h. The idea is to use at t the h unlabeled examples that precede t for model selection. The second extension takes advantage of the different error distributions of cross-validation and the metric methods: cross-validation tends to have a larger variance and is unbiased. A hybrid combining the two model selection methods is rarely beaten by any of the two methods. The third extension deals with the case when unlabeled data is not available at all, using an estimated input density. Experiments are described to study these extensions in the context of capacity control and feature subset selection.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques.
Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to monimize an overall peformance measure.
Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks.
A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with a global training technique to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.},

Collaborative filtering or, more generally, multi-task learning, is a machine learning approach that improves
the generalization performance of an algorithm by using information from related tasks as an inductive
bias. We use collaborative filtering techniques for building predictive models that link multiple targets to
multiple examples. The more commonalities between the targets, the better the multi-target model that can
be built. We show an example of a multi-target neural network that can use family information to produce
a predictive model of an undersampled target. We evaluate JRank, a kernel-based method designed for
collaborative filtering. We show their performance on compound prioritization for an HTS campaign and
the underlying shared representation between targets. JRank outperformed the neural network both in the

We propose a "hard parallelizable mixture" methodology which yields significantly reduced training time through modularization and parallelization: the training data is iteratively partitioned by a "gater" model in such a way that it becoms easy to learn an "expert" model separately in each region of the parition. A probabilistic extension and the use of a set of generative models allows representing a gater so that all pieces of the model are locally trained. For {SVM}s, time complexity appears empirically to locally grow linearly with the number of examples, while generalization performance can be enhanced. For the probabilistic version of the algorithm, the iterative algorithm provably goes down in a cost function that is an upper bound on the negative log-likelihood.},

For each of those datasets and for each of those arithmetics, we assess the impact of the precision of the computations on the final error of the training. We find that very low precision computation is sufficient not just for running trained networks but also for training them.

This paper follows up on proposed nonparametric algorithms which provide an estimated continuous label for the given unlabeled examples. First, it extends them to function induction algorithms that minimize a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happen to have the form of Parzen windows regressors. This allows to predict test labels without solving again a linear system of dimension n (the number of unlabeled and labeled training examples), which can cost O(n^3). Second, this function induction procedure gives rise to an efficient approximation of the training process, reducing the linear system to be solved to m << n unknowns, using only a subset of m examples. An improvement of O(n^2/m^2) in time can thus be obtained. Comparative experiments are presented, showing the good performance of the induction formula and approximation algorithm.},

order of O(kn2) time and O(kn) memory (for a sparse graph where each data point

from the rest of the data by approximating their label with a linear combination of
the labels in S (using the induction formula presented in Chapter 11). This leads

sharing make their architecture ideally suited for vision tasks by helping to enforce a prior based on our knowledge of natural images. This same prior could also be applied to recent developments in the field of deep networks, in order to tailor these new architectures for artificial vision. In this context, we show how the Restricted {Boltzmann} Machine (RBM), the building block of Deep Belief Networks (DBN), can be adapted to operate in a convolutional manner. We compare their performance to standard fully-connected RBMs on a simple visual learning task and show that the convolutional RBMs (CRBMs) converge to smaller values of the negative likelihood function. Our experiments also indicate that CRBMs are more efficient than standard RBMs trained on small image patches, with the CRBMs having faster convergence.}

Similar in spirit to the Hessian-Free method of Martens [8], our algorithm belongs to the family of truncated Newton methods and exploits an efficient matrix-vector product to avoid explicitely storing the natural gradient metric $L$. This metric is shown to be the expected second derivative of the log-partition function (under the model distribution), or equivalently, the variance of the vector of partial derivatives of the energy function. We evaluate our method on the task of joint-training a 3-layer Deep {Boltzmann} Machine and show that MFNG does indeed have faster per-epoch convergence compared to Stochastic Maximum Likelihood with centering, though wall-clock performance is currently not competitive.}

We suspect that this hinders the advantage that could in principle be brought by training algorithms relying on Gibbs sampling for uncovering spurious modes, such as the Persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm. To alleviate this problem, we
explore the use of tempered {Markov} Chain Monte-Carlo for sampling in RBMs. We find both through visualization of samples and measures of likelihood that it helps both sampling and learning.}

We analyzed the performance of several models within five broad categories: linear regressions, generalized linear models, decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines. In this paper, we present the main results of this study. We qualitatively compare models and show how neural networks can represent high-order nonlinear dependencies with a small number of parameters, each of which is estimated on a large proportion of the data, thus yielding low variance. We thoroughly explain the purpose of the nonlinear sigmoidal transforms which are at the very heart of neural networks' performances. The main numerical result is a statistically significant reduction in the out-of-sample mean-squared error using the neural network model and our ability to substantially reduce the median premium by charging more to the highest risks. This in turn can translate into substantial savings and financial benefits for an insurer. We hope this paper goes a long way towards convincing actuaries to include neural networks within their set of modeling tools for ratemaking.},

Here we consider the problem of extracting essential ingredients of music signals, such as well-defined global temporal structure in the form of nested periodicities (or {\em meter}). Can we construct an adaptive signal processing device that learns by example how to generate new instances of a given musical style? Because recurrent neural networks can in principle learn the temporal structure of a signal, they are good candidates for such a task. Unfortunately, music composed by standard recurrent neural networks ({RNN}s) often lacks global coherence. The reason for this failure seems to be that {RNN}s cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure. Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) has succeeded in similar domains where other {RNN}s have failed, such as timing \& counting and learning of context sensitive languages.

  abstract = {This dissertation uses a network of relaxation oscillators to beat along with temporal signals. Relaxation oscillators exhibit interspersed slow-fast movement and model a wide array of biological oscillations. The model is built up gradually: first a single relaxation oscillator is exposed to rhythms and shown to be good at finding downbeats in them. Then large networks of oscillators are mutually coupled in an exploration of their internal synchronization behavior. It is demonstrated that appropriate weights on coupling connections cause a network to form multiple pools of oscillators having stable phase relationships. This is a promising first step towards networks that can recreate a rhythmical pattern from memory. In the full model, a coupled network of relaxation oscillators is exposed to rhythmical patterns. It is shown that the network finds downbeats in patterns while continuing to exhibit good internal stability. A novel non-dynamical model of downbeat induction called the Normalized Positive (NP) clock model is proposed, analyzed, and used to generate comparison predictions for the oscillator model. The oscillator model compares favorably to other dynamical approaches to beat induction such as adaptive oscillators. However, the relaxation oscillator model takes advantage of intrinsic synchronization stability to allow the creation of large coupled networks. This research lays the groundwork for a long-term research goal, a robotic arm that responds to rhythmical signals by tapping along. It also opens the door to future work in connectionist learning of long rhythmical patterns.},

   abstract = {One major challenge in using statistical sequence learning methods in the domain of music lies in bridging the long timelags that separate important musical events. Consider, for example, the chord changes that convey the basic structure of a pop song. A sequence learner that cannot predict chord changes will almost certainly not be able to generate new examples in a musical style or to categorize songs by style. Yet, it is surprisingly difficult for a sequence learner to bridge the long timelags necessary to identify when a chord change will occur and what its new value will be. This is the case because chord changes can be separated by dozens or hundreds of intervening notes. One could solve this problem by treating chords as being special (as did Mozer, NIPS 1991). But this is impractical---it requires chords to be labeled specially in the dataset, limiting the applicability of the model to non-labeled examples---and furthermore does not address the general issue of nested temporal structure in music. I will briefly describe this temporal structure (known commonly as "meter") and present a model that uses to its advantage an assumption that sequences are metrical. The model consists of an autocorrelation-based filtration that estimates online the most likely metrical tree (i.e. the frequency and phase of beat, measure, phrase &etc.) and uses that to generate a series of sequences varying at different rates. These sequences correspond to each level in the hierarchy. Multiple learners can be used to treat each series separately and their predictions can be combined to perform composition and categorization. I will present preliminary results that demonstrate the usefulness of this approach. Time permitting I will also compare the model to alternate approaches.},

In an analysis we identify some shortcomings of the model and relate model behavior to dynamical properties of relaxation oscillators.},

     abstract = {In general music composed by recurrent neural networks ({RNN}s) suffers from a lack of global structure. Though networks can learn note-by-note transition probabilities and even reproduce phrases, attempts at learning an entire musical form and using that knowledge to guide composition have been unsuccessful. The reason for this failure seems to be that {RNN}s cannot keep track of temporally distant events that indicate global music structure. Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) has succeeded in similar domains where other {RNN}s have failed, such as timing \& counting and CSL learning. In the current study I show that {LSTM} is also a good mechanism for learning to compose music. I compare this approach to previous attempts, with particular focus on issues of data representation. I present experimental results showing that {LSTM} successfully learns a form of blues music and is able to compose novel (and I believe pleasing) melodies in that style. Remarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure it does not drift from it: {LSTM} is able to play the blues with good timing and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen. {\em Note: This is a more complete version of the 2002 ICANN submission Learning the Long-Term Structure of the Blues.}},

A nonlinear oscillator exhibiting this slow-fast behavior is called a relaxation oscillator and is used to model, for example, human heartbeat pacemaking and neural action potential. Similar limit cycle oscillators are used to model a wider range of behaviors including predator-prey relationships and synchrony in animal populations such as fireflies. Though nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators have been successfully applied to beat induction, relaxation oscillators have received less attention. In this work we offer a novel and effective relaxation oscillator model of beat induction. We outline the model in detail and provide a perturbation analysis of its response to external stimuli. In a series of simulations we expose the model to patterns from Experiment 1 of Povel \& Essens (1985). We then examine the beat assignments of the model. Although the overall performance of the model is very good, there are shortcomings. We believe that a network of mutually-coupled oscillators will address many of these shortcomings, and we suggest an appropriate course for future research.\\ {\em Note: See the 2001 {\em Psychological Research} article "Finding Downbeats with a Relaxation Oscillator" for a revised but less detailed version of this paper.}},

In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for {HMM}s and {IOHMM}s.},

Our results build on the work of Erhan et al. 2009, showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised training.

focused on those learned representations. One of the goals of our research
is to improve tools for finding good qualitative interpretations of high level features
learned by such models. We also seek to gain insight into the invariances learned by
deep networks. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques for finding
such interpretations. We applied our techniques on Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders
and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that consistent
filter-like interpretation is possible and simple to accomplish at the unit level. The tools
developed make it possible to analyze deep models in more depth and accomplish the
tracing of invariance manifolds for each of the hidden units. We hope that such techniques
will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why
deep architectures work.}

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

We introduce a deep variant of S3C which we call the partially directed deep {Boltzmann} machine (PD-DBM) and extend our S3C inference algorithm for use on this model. We describe learning procedures for each. We demonstrate that our inference procedure for S3C enables scaling the model to unprecedently large problem sizes, and demonstrate that using S3C as a feature extractor results in very good object recognition performance, particularly when the number of labeled examples is low. We show that the PD-DBM generates better samples than its shallow counterpart, and that unlike DBMs or DBNs, the PD-DBM may be trained successfully without greedy layerwise training.}

When trained on one task, then trained on a second task, many machine learning models "forget" how to perform the first task. This is widely believed to be a serious problem for neural networks. Here, we investigate the extent to which the catastrophic forgetting problem occurs for modern neural networks, comparing both established and recent gradient-based training algorithms and activation functions. We also examine the effect of the relationship between the first task and the second task on catastrophic forgetting. We find that it is always best to train using the dropout algorithm--the dropout algorithm is consistently best at adapting to the new task, remembering the old task, and has the best tradeoff curve between these two extremes. We find that different tasks and relationships between tasks result in very different rankings of activation function performance. This suggests the choice of activation function should always be cross-validated.}

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any {Markov} chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.}

labeled and unlabeled data. This task can be undertaken by discriminative methods,
provided that learning criteria are adapted consequently. In this chapter, we motivate the use of entropy regularization as a means to benefit from unlabeled data in
the framework of maximum a posteriori estimation. The learning criterion is derived
from clearly stated assumptions and can be applied to any smoothly parametrized
model of posterior probabilities. The regularization scheme favors low density separation, without any modeling of the density of input features. The contribution
of unlabeled data to the learning criterion induces local optima, but this problem
can be alleviated by deterministic annealing. For well-behaved models of posterior
probabilities, deterministic annealing {EM} provides a decomposition of the learning
problem in a series of concave subproblems. Other approaches to the semi-supervised
problem are shown to be close relatives or limiting cases of entropy regularization.
A series of experiments illustrates the good behavior of the algorithm in terms of
performance and robustness with respect to the violation of the postulated low density separation assumption. The minimum entropy solution benefits from unlabeled
data and is able to challenge mixture models and manifold learning in a number of
situations.},

In this paper we demonstrate that Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) is an {RNN} capable of robustly categorizing timewarped speech data, thus combining the most useful features of both paradigms. We compare its performance to {SNN}s on two variants of a spoken digit identification task, using data from an international competition. The first task (described in Nature (Nadis 2003)) required the categorisation of spoken digits with only a single training exemplar, and was specifically designed to test robustness to timewarping. Here {LSTM} performed better than all the {SNN}s in the competition. The second task was to predict spoken digits using a larger training set. Here {LSTM} greatly outperformed an {SNN}-like model found in the literature. These results suggest that {LSTM} has a place in domains that require the learning of large timewarped datasets, such as automatic speech recognition.},

We motivate our work from the hypothesis that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like {SVM}s, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not performed is due to the {\em composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably because of effective local minima.}

   abstract = {In this paper we present the techniques used for the University of Montr{\'{e}}al's team submissions to the 2013 Emotion Recognition in the Wild Challenge. The challenge is to classify the emotions expressed by the primary human subject in short video clips extracted from feature length movies. This involves the analysis of video clips of acted scenes lasting approximately one-two seconds, including the audio track which may contain human voices as well as background music. Our approach combines multiple deep neural networks for different data modalities, including: (1) a deep convolutional neural network for the analysis of facial expressions within video frames; (2) a deep belief net to capture audio information; (3) a deep autoencoder to model the spatio-temporal information produced by the human actions depicted within the entire scene; and (4) a shallow network architecture focused on extracted features of the mouth of the primary human subject in the scene. We discuss each of these techniques, their performance characteristics and different strategies to aggregate their predictions. Our best single model was a convolutional neural network trained to predict emotions from static frames using two large data sets, the Toronto Face Database and our own set of faces images harvested from Google image search, followed by a per frame aggregation strategy that used the challenge training data. This yielded a test set accuracy of 35.58\%. Using our best strategy for aggregating our top performing models into a single predictor we were able to produce an accuracy of 41.03\% on the challenge test set. These compare favorably to the challenge baseline test set accuracy of 27.56\%.}

Depuis cette d{\'{e}}couverte, des chercheurs ont {\'{e}}tudi{\'{e}} l’efﬁcacit{\'{e}} de nouvelles strat{\'{e}}gies de pr{\'{e}}-entra{\^{\i}}nement, telles que l’empilement d’auto-encodeurs traditionnels (SAE) [5, 38], et l’empilement d’auto-encodeur d{\'{e}}bruiteur (SDAE) [44].
    C’est dans ce contexte qu’a d{\'{e}}but{\'{e}} la pr{\'{e}}sente {\'{e}}tude. Apr{\`{e}}s un bref passage en revue des notions de base du domaine de l’apprentissage machine et des m{\'{e}}thodes de
pr{\'{e}}-entra{\^{\i}}nement employ{\'{e}}es jusqu’{\`{a}} pr{\'{e}}sent avec les modules RBM, AE et DAE, nous

l’inﬂuence du niveau de bruit, du nombre de couches et du nombre d’unit{\'{e}}s cach{\'{e}}es

for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In
this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for
RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This
approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.}

  abstract = {Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted {Boltzmann} machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.}

  abstract = {Le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle a pour objectif le d{\'{e}}veloppement de syst{\`{e}}mes informatiques capables de simuler des comportements normalement associ{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} l'intelligence humaine. On aimerait entre autres pouvoir construire une machine qui puisse
r{\'{e}}soudre des t{\^{a}}ches li{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} la vision (e.g., la reconnaissance d'objet), au traitement de la langue (e.g., l'identification du sujet d'un texte) ou au traitement de signaux sonores (e.g., la reconnaissance de la parole).
     Une approche d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}e afin de r{\'{e}}soudre ce genre de t{\^{a}}ches est bas{\'{e}}e sur l'apprentissage automatique de mod{\`{e}}les {\`{a}} partir de donn{\'{e}}es {\'{e}}tiquet{\'{e}}es refl{\'{e}}tant le comportement intelligent {\`{a}} {\'{e}}muler. Entre autre, il a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} propos{\'{e}} de mod{\'{e}}liser le calcul n{\'{e}}cessaire {\`{a}} la
r{\'{e}}solution d'une t{\^{a}}che {\`{a}} l'aide d'un r{\'{e}}seau de neurones artificiel, dont il est possible d'adapter le comportement {\`{a}} l'aide de la r{\'{e}}tropropagation [99, 131] d'un gradient informatif sur les erreurs commises par le r{\'{e}}seau. Populaire durant les ann{\'{e}}es 80, cette
approche sp{\'{e}}cifique a depuis perdu partiellement de son attrait, suite au d{\'{e}}veloppement des m{\'{e}}thodes {\`{a}} noyau. Celles-ci sont souvent plus stables, plus faciles {\`{a}} utiliser et leur performance est souvent au moins aussi {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}}e pour une vaste gamme de probl{\`{e}}mes.
     Les m{\'{e}}thodes d'apprentissage automatique ont donc progress{\'{e}} dans leur fonctionnement, mais aussi dans la complexit{\'{e}} des probl{\`{e}}mes auxquels elles se sont attaqu{\'{e}}. Ainsi, plus r{\'{e}}cemment, des travaux [12, 15] ont commenc{\'{e}} {\`{a}} {\'{e}}mettre des doutes sur la capacit{\'{e}} des machines {\`{a}} noyau {\`{a}} pouvoir efficacement r{\'{e}}soudre des probl{\`{e}}mes de la complexit{\'{e}} requise par l'intelligence artificielle. Parall{\`{e}}lement, Hinton et al. [81] faisaient une perc{\'{e}}e dans l'apprentissage automatique de r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones, en proposant une proc{\'{e}}dure permettant l'entra{\^{\i}}nement de r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones d'une plus grande complexit{\'{e}} (i.e., avec plus de couches de neurones cach{\'{e}}es) qu'il n'{\'{e}}tait possible auparavant.
     C'est dans ce contexte qu'ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} conduits les travaux de cette th{\`{e}}se. Cette th{\`{e}}se d{\'{e}}bute par une exposition des principes de base de l'apprentissage automatique (chapitre 1) et une discussion des obstacles {\`{a}} l'obtention d'un mod{\`{e}}le ayant une bonne performance
de g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralisation (chapitre 2). Puis, sont pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}es les contributions apport{\'{e}}es dans le cadre de cinq articles, contributions qui sont toutes bas{\'{e}}es sur l'utilisation d'une certaine
forme d'apprentissage non-supervis{\'{e}}.
    Le premier article (chapitre 4) propose une m{\'{e}}thode d'entra{\^{\i}}nement pour un type sp{\'{e}}cifique de r{\'{e}}seau {\`{a}} une seule couche cach{\'{e}}e (la machine de {Boltzmann} restreinte) bas{\'{e}}e sur une combinaison des apprentissages supervis{\'{e}} et non-supervis{\'{e}}. Cette m{\'{e}}thode permet d'obtenir une meilleure performance de g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ralisation qu'un r{\'{e}}seau de neurones standard ou qu'une machine {\`{a}} vecteurs de support {\`{a}} noyau, et met en {\'{e}}vidence de fa{\c c}on
explicite les b{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}fices qu'apporte l'apprentissage non-supervis{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'entra{\^{\i}}nement d'un r{\'{e}}seau de neurones.
    Ensuite, dans le second article (chapitre 6), on {\'{e}}tudie et {\'{e}}tend la proc{\'{e}}dure d'entra{\^{\i}}nement propos{\'{e}}e par Hinton et al. [81]. Plus sp{\'{e}}cifiquement, on y propose une approche diff{\'{e}}rente mais plus flexible pour initialiser un r{\'{e}}seau {\`{a}} plusieurs couches cach{\'{e}}es, bas{\'{e}}e sur un r{\'{e}}seau autoassociateur. On y explore aussi l'impact du nombre de couches et de neurones par couche sur la performance d'un r{\'{e}}seau et on y d{\'{e}}crit diff{\'{e}}rentes variantes mieux adapt{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} l'apprentissage en ligne ou pour donn{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} valeurs continues.
    Dans le troisi{\`{e}}me article (chapitre 8), on explore plut{\^{o}}t la performance de r{\'{e}}seaux profonds sur plusieurs probl{\`{e}}mes de classification diff{\'{e}}rents. Les probl{\`{e}}mes choisis ont la propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} d'avoir {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} partir de plusieurs facteurs de variation. Cette propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}, qui caract{\'{e}}rise les probl{\`{e}}mes li{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} l'intelligence artificielle, pose difficult{\'{e}} aux machines {\`{a}} noyau, tel que confirm{\'{e}} par les exp{\'{e}}riences de cet article.
    Le quatri{\`{e}}me article (chapitre 10) pr{\'{e}}sente une am{\'{e}}lioration de l'approche bas{\'{e}}e sur les r{\'{e}}seaux autoassociateurs. Cette am{\'{e}}lioration applique une modification simple {\`{a}} la proc{\'{e}}dure d'entra{\^{\i}}nement d'un r{\'{e}}seau autoassociateur, en « bruitant » les entr{\'{e}}es du r{\'{e}}seau afin que celui-ci soit forc{\'{e}} {\`{a}} la d{\'{e}}bruiter.
    Le cinqui{\`{e}}me et dernier article (chapitre 12) apporte une autre am{\'{e}}lioration aux r{\'{e}}seaux autoassociateurs, en permettant des interactions d'inhibition ou d'excitation entre les neurones cach{\'{e}}s de ces r{\'{e}}seaux. On y d{\'{e}}montre que de telles interactions peuvent
{\^{e}}tre apprises et sont b{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}fiques {\`{a}} la performance d'un r{\'{e}}seau profond.}

for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In
this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for
RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This
approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting.}

off-policy policy evaluation is important but where standard
approaches can hardly be applied. The objective of the policy
is to sequentially form teams of players from those waiting to
be matched, in such a way as to produce well-balanced matches.
Unfortunately, the available training data comes from a policy
that is not known perfectly and that is not stochastic, making
it impossible to use methods based on importance weights. Fur-
thermore, we observe that when the estimated reward function
and the policy are obtained by training from the same off-policy
dataset, the policy evaluation using the estimated reward function
is biased. We present a simple calibration procedure that is
similar to stacked regression and that removes most of the bias,
in the experiments we performed. Data collected during beta
tests of Ghost Recon Online, a first person shooter from Ubisoft,
were used for the experiments.}

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. 
Real-life document recognition systems are composed or multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. 
Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks. 
A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.},

Under mild assumptions, we also find better error bounds than with ordinary neural networks. Furthermore, this parametrization may help reducing the problem of saturation of the neurons. In a second approach, the input-to-hidden weights arefully non-parametric, yielding a kernel machine for which we demonstrate a simple kernel formula.

Bien qu'ils aient {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} {\'{e}}tudi{\'{e}}s pour la premi{\`{e}}re fois il y a cinquante ans par Rosenblatt [68], ils ne furent r{\'{e}}ellement populaires qu'apr{\`{e}}s l'apparition de la r{\'{e}}tropropagation du gradient, en 1986 [71].
En 1989, il a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} prouv{\'{e}} [44] qu'une classe sp{\'{e}}cifique de r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones (les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e) {\'{e}}tait suffisamment puissante pour pouvoir approximer presque n'importe quelle fonction avec une pr{\'{e}}cision arbitraire : le th{\'{e}}or{\`{e}}me d'approximation universelle. Toutefois, bien que ce th{\'{e}}or{\`{e}}me e{\^{u}}t pour cons{\'{e}}quence un int{\'{e}}r{\^{e}}t accru pour les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones, il semblerait qu'aucun effort n'ait {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} fait pour profiter de cette propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}.
En outre, l'optimisation des r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e n'est pas convexe. Cela a d{\'{e}}tourn{\'{e}} une grande partie de la communaut{\'{e}} vers d'autres algorithmes, comme par exemple les machines {\`{a}} noyau (machines {\`{a}} vecteurs de support et r{\'{e}}gression
{\`{a}} noyau, entre autres).
La premi{\`{e}}re partie de cette th{\`{e}}se pr{\'{e}}sentera les concepts d'apprentissage machine g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}raux n{\'{e}}cessaires {\`{a}} la compr{\'{e}}hension des algorithmes utilis{\'{e}}s. La deuxi{\`{e}}me partie se focalisera plus sp{\'{e}}cifiquement sur les m{\'{e}}thodes {\`{a}} noyau et les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones. La troisi{\`{e}}me partie de ce travail visera ensuite {\`{a}} {\'{e}}tudier les limitations des machines {\`{a}} noyaux et {\`{a}} comprendre les raisons pour lesquelles elles sont inadapt{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} certains probl{\`{e}}mes que nous avons {\`{a}} traiter.
La quatri{\`{e}}me partie pr{\'{e}}sente une technique permettant d'optimiser les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e de mani{\`{e}}re convexe. Bien que cette technique s'av{\`{e}}re difficilement exploitable pour des probl{\`{e}}mes de grande taille, une version approch{\'{e}}e permet d'obtenir une bonne solution dans un temps raisonnable.
La cinqui{\`{e}}me partie se concentre sur les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e infinie. Cela leur permet th{\'{e}}oriquement d'exploiter la propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} d'approximation universelle et ainsi d'approcher facilement une plus grande classe de fonctions.
Toutefois, si ces deux variations sur les r{\'{e}}seaux de neurones {\`{a}} une couche cach{\'{e}}e leur conf{\`{e}}rent des propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}s int{\'{e}}ressantes, ces derniers ne peuvent extraire plus que des concepts de bas niveau.

     abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made or words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly improves on a state-of-the-art trigram model, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of much longer contexts.},

Yet little work with music streams has been conducted and these features remain mostly unused in the MIR community. In this paper we further explore the use of these features for musical signals.

modeling affect manifested through physiology. The efficiency
of DL algorithms that train artificial neural network models is
tested and compared against standard feature extraction and
selection approaches followed in the literature. Results on a game
data corpus — containing players’ physiological signals (i.e. skin
conductance and blood volume pulse) and subjective self-reports
of affect — reveals that DL outperforms manual ad-hoc feature
extraction as it yields significantly more accurate affective models.
Moreover, it appears that DL meets and even outperforms
affective models that are boosted by automatic feature selection,
for several of the scenarios examined. As the DL method is
generic and applicable to any affective modeling task, the key
findings of the paper suggest that ad-hoc feature extraction and
selection — to a lesser degree — could be bypassed.}

and a wide range of illumination or scale conditions. Standard approaches build an
intermediate representation of the global image and learn classiﬁers on it. Recently, it
has been proposed to depict an image as an aggregation of its contained objects: the
representation on which classiﬁers are trained is composed of many heterogeneous
feature vectors derived from various object detectors. In this paper, we propose
to study different approaches to efﬁciently learn contextual semantics out of these
object detections. We use the features provided by Object-Bank [24] (177 different
object detectors producing 252 attributes each), and show on several benchmarks for
scene categorization that careful combinations, taking into account the structure of
the data, allows to greatly improve over original results (from +5 to +11 \%) while
drastically reducing the dimensionality of the representation by 97 \% (from 44,604
to 1,000). We also show that the uncertainty relative to object detectors hampers the
use of external semantic knowledge to improve detectors combination, unlike our
unsupervised learning approach.}

However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy.},

This could lead to gross underestimation of the variance of the cross-validation estimator, and to the wrong conclusion that the new algorithm is significantly better when it is not. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of a cross-validation estimator of the generalization error that takes into account the variability due to the randomness of the training set as well as test examples. Our analysis shows that all the variance estimators that are based only on the results of the cross-validation experiment must be biased.

to explore non-local manifold learning algorithms which attempt to discover
shared structure in the tangent planes at different positions. A criterion for
such an algorithm is proposed and experiments estimating a tangent plane
prediction function are presented, showing its advantages with respect to
local manifold learning algorithms: it is able to generalize very far from
training data (on learning handwritten character image rotations), where a

In order to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the estimation of uncertainty around the K-fold cross-validation estimator. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. An analysis based on the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of errors helps to better understand the nature of the problem and shows that naive estimators may grossly underestimate variance, as confirmed by numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {We present a series of theoretical arguments supporting the claim that a
large class of modern learning algorithms that rely solely on the smoothness
prior  with similarity between examples expressed with a local
kernel  are sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, or more precisely
to the variability of the target. Our discussion covers supervised, semisupervised
and unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are
found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function
at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This
makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for
classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the
Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations,
these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to
the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist
short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity
may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning
algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured
but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations),
while not using very specific prior domain knowledge.},

In this framework, we motivate minimum entropy regularization, which enables to incorporate unlabeled data in the standard supervised learning. Our approach includes other approaches to the semi-supervised problem as particular or limiting cases. A series of experiments illustrates that the proposed solution benefits from unlabeled data. The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model. The performances are definitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspecified, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the cluster assumption. Finally, we also illustrate that the method can also be far superior to manifold learning in high dimension spaces.},

Although that direction can be very expensive to compute we develop an efficient, general, online approximation to the natural gradient descent which is suited to large scale problems.

If someone gave us a learning task involving images for which the two-dimensional topology of pixels was not known, could we discover it automatically and exploit it? For example suppose that the pixels had been permuted in a fixed but unknown way, could we recover the relative two-dimensional location of pixels on images? The surprising result presented here is that not only the answer is yes but that about as few as a thousand images are enough to approximately recover the relative locations of about a thousand pixels. This is achieved using a manifold learning algorithm applied to pixels associated with a measure of distributional similarity between pixel intensities. We compare different topologyextraction approaches and show how having the two-dimensional topology can be exploited.}

  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: we propose to fight it with its own weapons. In the proposed approach one learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word (i.e. a similarity between words) along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed with these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that
has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly improves on a state-of-the-art trigram model.},

The training criterion used in {SVM}s is not appropriate for this purpose so we adopt the simple criterion that is generally used when training neural networks for classification tasks.

In the case of kernel {PCA} or spectral clustering this reduces computation to O(m^2 n). For the same computational complexity, we can also compute the feature space projection of the non-selected examples on the subspace spanned by the selected examples, to estimate the embedding function based on all the data, which yields considerably better estimation of the embedding function. This algorithm can be formulated in an online setting and we can bound the error on the approximation of the Gram matrix.},

  abstract = {Generative Stochastic Networks (GSNs) have been recently introduced as an alternative to traditional probabilistic modeling: instead of parametrizing the data distribution directly, one parametrizes a transition operator for a {Markov} chain whose stationary distribution is an estimator of the data generating distribution. The result of training is therefore a machine that generates samples through this {Markov} chain. However, the previously introduced GSN consistency theorems suggest that in order to capture a wide class of distributions, the transition operator in general should be multimodal, something that has not been done before this paper. We introduce for the first time multimodal transition distributions for GSNs, in particular using models in the NADE family (Neural Autoregressive Density Estimator) as output distributions of the transition operator. A NADE model is related to an RBM (and can thus model multimodal distributions) but its likelihood (and likelihood gradient) can be computed easily. The parameters of the NADE are obtained as a learned function of the previous state of the learned {Markov} chain. Experiments clearly illustrate the advantage of such multimodal transition distributions over unimodal GSNs.}

Secondly we re-derive natural gradient from basic principles, contrasting the difference between two versions of the algorithm found in the neural network literature, as well as highlighting a few differences between natural gradient and typical second order methods. Lastly we show empirically that natural gradient can be robust to overfitting and particularly it can be robust to the order in which the training data is presented to the model.}

By carefully analyzing and understanding the architecture of an {RNN}, we define three points which may be made deeper; (1) input-to-hidden function, (2) hidden-to-hidden transition and (3) hidden-to-output function. This can be considered in addition to stacking multiple recurrent layers proposed earlier by Schmidhuber (1992). Based on this observation, we propose two novel architectures of a deep {RNN} and provide an alternative interpretation of these deep RNN's using a novel framework based on neural operators. The proposed deep RNN's are empirically evaluated on the tasks of polyphonic music prediction and language modeling. The experimental result supports our claim that the proposed deep RNN's benefit from the depth and outperform the conventional, shallow {RNN}.}

This is a contribution to the growing body of work contrasting the representational power of deep and shallow network architectures. In particular, we offer a framework for comparing deep and shallow models that belong to the family of piece-wise linear functions based on computational geometry. We look at a deep (two hidden layers) rectifier multilayer perceptron (MLP) with linear outputs units and compare it with a single layer version of the model. In the asymptotic regime as the number of units goes to infinity, if the shallow model has $2n$ hidden units and $n_0$ inputs, then the number of linear regions is $O(n^{n_0})$. A two layer model with $n$ number of hidden units on each layer has $\Omega(n^{n_0})$. We consider this as a first step towards understanding the complexity of these models and argue that better constructions in this framework might provide more accurate comparisons (especially for the interesting case of when the number of hidden layers goes to infinity).}

While this is true for some data, it is clearly not true for some other. We present here a modification of the M algorithm that allows negative updates. Negative updates are used to maintain a window over the source. Symbols enter the window at its right and will leave it at its left, after w steps (the window width). The algorithm presented here allows us to update correctly the weights of the symbols in the symbol tree.

  responds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder

  on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term
  is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising encoders and
  how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic
  auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a rep-
  resentation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated
  by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold,
  while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal
  to the manifold. Finally, we show that by using the learned features to
  initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range

early stopping (Morgan and Bourlard, 1990), weight decay, output smoothing that
are used to avoid overfitting during the training of the considered model. From
a Bayesian point of view, many regularization techniques correspond to imposing
certain prior distributions on model parameters (Krogh and Hertz, 1991). Using
Bishop’s approximation (Bishop, 1995) of the objective function when a restricted
type of noise is added to the input of a parametric function, we derive the higher
order terms of the Taylor expansion and analyze the coefficients of the regularization
terms induced by the noisy input. In particular we study the effect of penalizing the
Hessian of the mapping function with respect to the input in terms of generalization
performance. We also show how we can control independently this coefficient by
explicitly penalizing the Jacobian of the mapping function on corrupted inputs.}

to the pose of the face in the image after centering and alignment, (2) the
identity or morphology of the face. In order to achieve this invariance,
we propose to learn a hierarchy of features in which we gradually ﬁlter
the factors of variation arising from both (1) and (2). We address (1) by
using a multi-scale contractive convolutional network (CCNET) in order
to obtain invariance to translations of the facial traits in the image. Using
the feature representation produced by the CCNET, we train a Contrac-
tive Discriminative Analysis (CDA) feature extractor, a novel variant of
the Contractive Auto-Encoder (CAE), designed to learn a representation
separating out the emotion-related factors from the others (which mostly
capture the subject identity, and what is left of pose after the CCNET).
This system beats the state-of-the-art on a recently proposed dataset
for facial expression recognition, the Toronto Face Database, moving the
state-of-art accuracy from 82.4\% to 85.0\%, while the CCNET and CDA
improve accuracy of a standard CAE by 8\%.}

  abstract = {Dopaminergic neuron activity has been modeled during learning and appetitive behavior, most commonly using the temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. However, a proper representation of elapsed time and of the exact task is usually required for the model to work. Most models use timing elements such as delay-line representations of time that are not biologically realistic for intervals in the range of seconds. The interval-timing literature provides several alternatives. One of them is that timing could emerge from general network dynamics, instead of coming from a dedicated circuit. Here, we present a general rate-based learning model based on long short-term memory ({LSTM}) networks that learns a time representation when needed. Using a na{\"{\i}}ve network learning its environment in conjunction with TD, we reproduce dopamine activity in appetitive trace conditioning with a constant CS-US interval, including probe trials with unexpected delays. The proposed model learns a representation of the environment dynamics in an adaptive biologically plausible framework, without recourse to delay lines or other special-purpose circuits. Instead, the model predicts that the task-dependent representation of time is learned by experience, is encoded in ramp-like changes in single-neuron activity distributed across small neural networks, and reflects a temporal integration mechanism resulting from the inherent dynamics of recurrent loops within the network. The model also reproduces the known finding that trace conditioning is more difficult than delay conditioning and that the learned representation of the task can be highly dependent on the types of trials experienced during training. Finally, it suggests that the phasic dopaminergic signal could facilitate learning in the cortex.}

Most current timing models either require a central clock and unbounded accumulator or whole pre-defined populations of delay lines, decaying traces or oscillators to represent elapsing time. Current adaptive recurrent neural networks fail at learning to predict the timing of future events (the 'when') in a realistic manner. In this paper, we present a new model of interval timing, based on simple temporal integrators, derived from drift-diffusion models. We develop a simple geometric rule to learn 'when' instead of 'what'. We provide an analytical proof that the model can learn inter-event intervals in a number of trials independent of the interval size and that the temporal precision of the system is proportional to the timed interval. This new model uses no clock, no gradient, no unbounded accumulators, no delay lines, and has internal noise allowing generations of individual trials. Three interesting predictions are made.}

        Throughout lifetime, the brain develops abstract representations of its
environment that allow the individual to maximize his benefits. How these
representations are developed while trying to acquire rewards remains a mystery. It is
reasonable to assume that these representations arise in the cortex and that the basal
ganglia are playing an important role in reward maximization. In particular,
dopaminergic neurons appear to code a reward prediction error signal. This thesis
studies the problem by constructing, using machine learning tools, a computational
model that incorporates a number of relevant neurophysiological findings.
        After an introduction to the machine learning framework and to some of its
algorithms, an overview of learning in psychology and neuroscience, and a review of
models of learning in the basal ganglia, the thesis comprises three papers. The first
article shows that it is possible to learn a better representation of the inputs while
learning to maximize reward. The second paper addresses the important and still
unresolved problem of the representation of time in the brain. The paper shows that a
time representation can be acquired automatically in an artificial neural network
acting like a working memory. The representation learned by the model closely
resembles the activity of cortical neurons in similar tasks. Moreover, the model shows
that the reward prediction error signal could accelerate the development of the
temporal representation. Finally, it shows that if such a learned representation exists
in the cortex, it could provide the necessary information to the basal ganglia to
explain the dopaminergic signal. The third article evaluates the explanatory and
predictive power of the model on the effects of differences in task conditions such as
the presence or absence of a stimulus (classical versus trace conditioning) while
waiting for the reward. Beyond making interesting predictions relevant to the timing
literature, the paper reveals some shortcomings of the model that will need to be
resolved.
       In summary, this thesis extends current models of reinforcement learning of
the basal ganglia and the dopaminergic system to the concurrent development of
representation in the cortex and to the interactions between these two regions.}

representation to contract the input space by regularizing the norm of

coder’s output with respect to its input, at the training points. While
the penalty on the Jacobian’s norm ensures robustness to tiny corrup-
tion of samples in the input space, constraining the norm of the Hes-
sian extends this robustness when moving further away from the sample.
From a manifold learning perspective, balancing this regularization with
the auto-encoder’s reconstruction objective yields a representation that
varies most when moving along the data manifold in input space, and
is most insensitive in directions orthogonal to the manifold. The second
order regularization, using the Hessian, penalizes curvature, and thus
favors smooth manifold. We show that our proposed technique, while
remaining computationally eﬃcient, yields representations that are sig-
niﬁcantly better suited for initializing deep architectures than previously
proposed approaches, beating state-of-the-art performance on a number

In particular, we compare training methods based on sampling the training set and weighting the cost function. The results suggest that random resampling of the training data is not the main explanation of the success of the improvements brought by AdaBoost. This is in contrast to Bagging which directly aims at reducing variance and for which random resampling is essential to obtain the reduction in generalization error. Our system achieves about 1.4\% error on a data set of online handwritten digits from more than 200 writers. A boosted multi-layer network achieved 1.5\% error on the UCI Letters and 8.1\% error on the UCI satellite data set, which is significantly better than boosted decision trees.},

form a sentence-level feature vector. Finally, a non-linear 
transformation is applied to extract high-level semantic

Open source tools have recently reached a level of maturity which makes them suitable for building large-scale real-world systems. At the same time, the field of machine learning has developed a large body of powerful learning algorithms for diverse applications. However, the true potential of these methods is not used, since existing implementations are not openly shared, resulting in software with low usability, and weak interoperability. We argue that this situation can be significantly improved by increasing incentives for researchers to publish their software under an open source model. Additionally, we outline the problems authors are faced with when trying to publish algorithmic implementations of machine learning methods. We believe that a resource of peer reviewed software accompanied by short articles would be highly valuable to both the machine learning and the general scientific community.}

Recently, Quantum Theory (QT) has been proposed as a possible, more general framework for IR. However, only a limited number of investigations have been made and the potential of QT has not been fully explored and tested. We develop a new, generalized Language Modeling approach for IR by adopting the probabilistic framework of QT. In particular, quantum probability could account for both single and compound terms at once without having to extend the term space artificially as in previous studies. This naturally allows us to avoid the weight-normalization problem, which arises in the current practice by mixing scores from matching compound terms and from matching single terms. Our model is the first practical application of quantum probability to show significant improvements over a robust bag-of-words baseline and achieves better performance on a stronger non bag-of-words baseline.}

This thesis considers a number of approaches to make machine learning algorithms better suited to the sequential nature of financial portfolio management tasks. We start by considering the problem of the general composition of learning algorithms that must handle temporal learning tasks, in particular that of creating and efficiently updating the training sets in a sequential simulation framework. We enumerate the desiderata that composition primitives should satisfy, and underscore the difficulty of rigorously and efficiently reaching them. We follow by introducing a set of algorithms that accomplish the desired objectives, presenting a case-study of a real-world complex learning system for financial decision-making that uses those techniques. We then describe a general method to transform a non-Markovian sequential decision problem into a supervised learning problem using a K-best paths search algorithm. We consider an application in financial portfolio management where we train a learning algorithm to directly optimize a Sharpe Ratio (or other risk-averse non-additive) utility function. We illustrate the approach by demonstrating extensive experimental results using a neural network architecture specialized for portfolio management and compare against well-known alternatives. Finally, we introduce a functional representation of time series which allows forecasts to be performed over an unspecified horizon with progressively-revealed information sets. By virtue of using Gaussian processes, a complete covariance matrix between forecasts at several time-steps is available. This information is put to use in an application to actively trade price spreads between commodity futures contracts. The approach delivers impressive out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns after transaction costs on a portfolio of 30 spreads.}

  abstract = {Social tags are user-generated keywords associated with some resource on the Web. In the case of music, social tags have become an important component of "Web 2.0" recommender systems, allowing users to generate playlists based on use-dependent terms such as chill or jogging that have been applied to particular songs. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting these social tags directly from MP3 files. Using a set of 360 classifiers trained using the online ensemble learning algorithm FilterBoost, we map audio features onto social tags collected from the Web. The resulting automatic tags (or autotags) furnish information about music that is otherwise untagged or poorly tagged, allowing for insertion of previously unheard music into a social recommender. This avoids the cold-start problem common in such systems. Autotags can also be used to smooth the tag space from which similarities and
recommendations are made by providing a set of comparable  baseline tags for all tracks in a recommender system. Because the words we learn are the same as those used by people who label their music collections, it is easy to integrate our predictions into existing similarity and prediction methods based on web data.}

Here, a theoretical framework is proposed to account for experimental results specifying the role of presynaptic activation, postsynaptic activation, and concentrations of extracellular DA in synaptic plasticity. Our starting point was an explicitly-implemented multiplicative rule linking STDP to Michaelis-Menton equations that models the dynamics of extracellular DA ﬂuctuations. This rule captures a wide range of results on conditions leading to long-term potentiation and depression in simulations that manipulate the frequency of induced corticostriatal stimulation and DA release. A well-documented biphasic function relating DA concentrations to synaptic plasticity emerges naturally from simulations involving a multiplicative rule linking DA and neural activity. This biphasic function is found consistently across different neural coding schemes employed (voltage-based vs. spike-based models). By comparison, an additive rule fails to capture these results. The proposed framework is the ﬁrst to generate testable predictions on the dual inﬂuence of DA concentrations and STDP on long-term plasticity, suggesting a way in which the biphasic inﬂuence of DA concentrations can modulate the direction and magnitude of change induced by STDP, and raising the possibility that DA concentrations may inverse the LTP/LTD components of the STDP rule.}

This analysis helps to better understand the nature of the problem and how it can make na{\"{\i}}ve estimators (that dont take into account the error correlations due to the overlap between training and test sets) grossly underestimate variance.

Numerical experiments on real data show that the generalizations performed have a level of error comparable to the variability of the embedding algorithms to the choice of training data.},

This paper follows up on proposed non-parametric algorithms which provide an estimated continuous label for the given unlabeled examples. It extends them to function induction algorithms that correspond to the minimization of a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happens to have the form of a Parzen windows regressor. The advantage of the extension is that it allows predicting the label for a new example without having to solve again a linear system of dimension n (the number of unlabeled and labeled training examples), which can cost O(n^3). Experiments show that the extension works well, in the sense of predicting a label close to the one that would have been obtained if the test example had been included in the unlabeled set. This relatively efficient function induction procedure can also be used when n is large to approximate the solution by writing it only in terms of a kernel expansion with m << n terms, and reducing the linear system to m equations in m unknowns.},

This analysis suggests non-local manifold learning algorithms which attempt to discover shared structure in the tangent planes at different positions.

     abstract = {Deep architectures have demonstrated state-of-the-art results in a variety of
settings, especially with vision datasets. Beyond the model definitions and the quantitative analyses, there is a need for qualitative comparisons of the solutions learned by various deep architectures. The goal of this paper is to find good qualitative interpretations of high level features represented by such models. To this end, we contrast and compare several techniques applied on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders and Deep Belief Networks, trained on several vision datasets. We show that, perhaps counter-intuitively, such interpretation is possible at the unit level, that it is simple to accomplish and that the results are consistent across various techniques. We hope that such techniques will allow researchers in deep architectures to understand more of how and why deep architectures work}

  abstract = {The recently introduced dropout training criterion for neural networks has been the subject of much attention due to its simplicity and remarkable effectiveness as a regularizer, as well as its interpretation as a training procedure for an exponentially large ensemble of networks that share parameters. In this work we empirically investigate several questions related to the efficacy of dropout, specifically as it concerns networks employing the popular rectified linear activation function. We investigate the quality of the test time weight-scaling inference procedure by evaluating the geometric average exactly in small models, as well as compare the performance of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean more commonly employed by ensemble techniques. We explore the effect of tied weights on the ensemble interpretation by training ensembles of masked networks without tied weights. Finally, we investigate an alternative criterion based on a biased estimator of the maximum likelihood ensemble gradient.}

     title = {Multi-Tasking with Joint Semantic Spaces for Large-Scale Music Annotation and Retrieval},
   journal = {Journal of New Music Research},
      year = {2011},
  abstract = {Music prediction tasks range from predicting tags given a song or clip
of audio, predicting the name of the artist, or predicting related
songs given a song, clip, artist name or tag. That is, we are
interested in every semantic relationship between the different
musical concepts in our database. In realistically sized databases,
the number of songs is measured in the hundreds of thousands or more,
and the number of artists in the tens of thousands or more, providing
a considerable challenge to standard machine learning techniques. In
this work, we propose a method that scales to such datasets which
attempts to capture the semantic similarities between the database
items by modeling audio, artist names, and tags in a single
low-dimensional semantic embedding space. This choice of space is
learnt by optimizing the set of prediction tasks of interest jointly
using multi-task learning. Our single model learnt by training on the
joint objective function is shown experimentally to have improved
accuracy over training on each task alone. Our method also outperforms
the baseline methods tried and, in comparison to them, is faster and
consumes less memory. We also demonstrate how our method learns an
interpretable model, where the semantic space captures well the
similarities of interest.
